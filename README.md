# Snowball Sytax definition for Sublime Text 3
I made this initially for personal use to work on the Arabic stemmer since I looked around and can't find any editor that has a highlight for editing snowball files. 

### Install
Drop the `Snowball.sublime-syntax` file into your Packages folder (Preferences > Browse Packagesâ€¦).
